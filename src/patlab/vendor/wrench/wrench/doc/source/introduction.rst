streams.

Wrench was previously known as php-websocket. Why the name change? See
`Frequently Asked Questions about the PHP License
<http://php.net/license/index.php#fac-lic>`_.  Also, the namespace WebSocket
is too generic; it denotes a common functionality, and may already be in use
by application code. The BC break of a new `major version
<http://semver.org/>`_ was a good time to introduce this move to best
practices.
