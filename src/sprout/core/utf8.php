/**
 * A port of phputf8 to a unified file/class. Checks PHP status to ensure that
 * UTF-8 support is available and normalize global variables to UTF-8. It also
 * provides multi-byte aware replacement string functions.
 *
 * This file is licensed differently from the rest of Kohana. As a port of
 * phputf8, which is LGPL software, this file is released under the LGPL.
 *
 * PCRE needs to be compiled with UTF-8 support (--enable-utf8).
 * Support for Unicode properties is highly recommended (--enable-unicode-properties).
 * @see http://php.net/manual/reference.pcre.pattern.modifiers.php
 *
 * UTF-8 conversion will be much more reliable if the iconv extension is loaded.
 * @see http://php.net/iconv
 *
 * The mbstring extension is highly recommended, but must not be overloading
 * string functions.
 * @see http://php.net/mbstring
