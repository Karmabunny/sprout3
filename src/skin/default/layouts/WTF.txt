Wondering what the diff is between Core and Components?

Core are single-use per page bits of code that's used across most, if not all templates.
eg.header, footer, google analytics etc.

Components are kinda everything else. Bits of code that could be used either once for across a couple of pages/templates
eg. promos, cards, sidebar, children's page gallery etc.
