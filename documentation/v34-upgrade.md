# SproutCMS 3.4

Grab-bag of features; AI, email reports, honeypots, PHP 8.2!


## Overview

This version _requires_ PHP 8.1+.

We've done our best to make 8.2 work, but there's likely some small things that have slipped past.



## Upgrading


```sh
composer require -W sproutcms/cms:3.4.*

# That's it. Walk away.
```

_Alternatively use the `^3.4` constraint._ But that may install a **newer** Sprout that may have breaking changes.

Apologies in advance that we've made a good mess of semver already.
